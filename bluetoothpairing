### I found this solution when I tried to connect my Logitech MX Keys on Debian 12 Bookworm and the bluetooth connection kept dropping.
### I believe it will work with any bluetooth keyboards
### On terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T or Alt + T), run the following commands:
# bluetoothctl
# power off
# power on
# agent KeyboardOnly
# default-agent
# pairable on
# scan on								### Copy your keyboard mac-address 
# pair <<mac address>> 	### Paste your mac-address here. You will get the 6 number code to type on you keyboard
trust <mac address>			### Here...
connect <mac address>		### And here.
quit

### Done! Your keyboard should now bem connected and working properly.
